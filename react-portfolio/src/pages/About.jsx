          Hi! I'm Dastan, an enthusiastic web developer with a passion for creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly websites. I enjoy bringing ideas to life through code and design, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a background in both design and programming, I love working on projects that make a difference and help people connect. I value teamwork, creativity, and continuous growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, you'll find me exploring new tech trends, playing strategy games, or enjoying a good book. I'm excited to share my work with youâ€”feel free to check out my projects and reach out if you'd like to collaborate!
